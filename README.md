# fyne-bug

This repo creates a MVP demonstrating an issue with the ALT key grabbing focus to the menubar.

## Running the Application

To build and run the application:

```bash
go build -o fyne-bug-demo main.go
./fyne-bug-demo
```

Or run directly:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Description

The application creates a minimal Fyne GUI with:
- A "Hello, World!" message in the center of the window
- A menubar with File, Edit, and View menus
- Standard menu items in each menu (placeholder actions)

This setup can be used to demonstrate and test ALT key behavior with the menubar.
